# Data Analytics Maastricht - Intensive Care
Data Analytics Maatricht Intensive Care (DAM-IC) is a group of researchers and clinicians at the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ who focus on data-driven healthcare applications. This GitHub repsitory houses the code that we use for our research. We invite the scientific community to view, reproduce, validate, and build upon our open code base. We are open to discussion, collaboration, feedback, and questions on anything regarding our work. Feel free to contact us at DAM-IC@mumc.nl.

## Our current repositories
### 1) [Deep Embedded Clustering generalisability and adaptation for mixed data types](https://github.com/DAM-IC/Deep-Embedded-Clustering-generalisability-and-adaptation-for-mixed-data-types)
This repository contains the code that was used for [our publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51699-z) where we externally validated a clinical deep embedded clustering (DEC) model on a new population to asses its generalisability. We also adapted the DEC model to X-DEC, which uses an x-shaped variational autoencoder to integrate categorical and numerical variables. The code to use X-DEC to cluster your own data can also be found in this repostitory.

### 2) [Table 0; documenting the steps to go from clinical database to research dataset](https://github.com/DAM-IC/Table-0-documenting-the-steps-to-go-from-clinical-database-to-research-dataset)
This repostitory contains the code of [one of our publciations](https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(24)00097-0/fulltext), it shows how we extracted an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) population dataset from a clinical source database and prepare it for research purposes.
